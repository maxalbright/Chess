# Chess

This unrefined program uses a basic i/o to allow for chess games to be played. It uses polymorphism to keep track of which moves for various chess pieces are
viable and legal. At the time of writing this, the program does not monitor checks and checkmates nor does it allow for pawn promotions. Otherwise, it seems to be relatively complete.
