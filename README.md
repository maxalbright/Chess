# Chess

This unrefined program uses a basic i/o to allow for chess games to be played. It uses polymorphism to keep track of which moves for various chess pieces are
viable and legal. At the time of writing this, the program does not monitor checks and checkmates. Otherwise, it seems to be relatively complete. See the promotion branch for an updated chessclass.cpp file the allows for pawn promtions to Queens, Bishops, Knights, and Rooks.
