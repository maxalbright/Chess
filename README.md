# Chess

THE CHESS.CPP FILE IN THIS BRANCH ALLOWS FOR PAWN PROMOTIONS TO QUEENS, BISHOPS, KNIGHTS, AND ROOKS
This unrefined program uses a basic i/o to allow for chess games to be played. It uses polymorphism to keep track of which moves for various chess pieces are
viable and legal. At the time of writing this, the program does not monitor checks and checkmates. Otherwise, it seems to be relatively complete.
